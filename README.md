# vue-todo-app

This ToDo App is my first attempt at creating an application using the Vue.JS front-end framework. To create this application, I followed the tutorial created by Traversy Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy9q22isx3U.

The basic function of this application are as follows:

- Add a ToDo item
- Delete a ToDo item
- Mark a ToDo item as completed
- View an about page

This app was created using the 'vue create' command in the command line. It uses async/await promise syntax, JSONplaceholder for sample json data, and vue router plugin to make navigating the single page app a breeze.
